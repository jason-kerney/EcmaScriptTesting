# EcmaScript Tests #

This is a simple console-based application written in node. It was written with some poor coding choices and no tests. This was done to allow for a variety of exercises.

## The Application ##

This is a Pizza ordering application. When it starts it opens an order and allows you to choose toppings and amounts and gives you a total at the end.

## The Exercises ##

### Exercise 1 ###

Using [Signet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signet) add types, and sign all out puts with those types.

### Exercise 3 ###

Using [Mockery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mockery) and [sinon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon) write tests for the codebase.

- Verify that all functionality works.
- Verify that user input is handled correctly
- Aim for 90+% test coverage

### Exercise 4 ###

Convert module requires to [DJect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dject). Modify tests and remove Mockery.
